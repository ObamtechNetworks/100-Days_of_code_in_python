## About the Challenge

The 100 Days of Code challenge is a commitment to improve coding skills and consistency. By coding for at least an hour every day, I aim to build a strong foundation in Python programming and develop a habit of regular coding practice.

## My Goals

- **Learn Python Fundamentals:** Strengthen my understanding of Python basics, including variables, data types, loops, and functions.
- **Build Projects:** Apply my knowledge by working on real-world projects to enhance problem-solving skills.
- **Explore Python Libraries:** Dive into popular Python libraries for web development, data analysis, and more.
- **Connect with the Community:** Share my progress, learn from others, and contribute to the coding community.

## Course Structure

I am following the course structure outlined by Angela Yu in her Python programming course. The structure includes a well-rounded curriculum covering:

- **Python Basics**
- **Intermediate Python**
- **Web Development with Flask and Django**
- **Data Science and Machine Learning**

## Journey Breakdown
The 100-day journey is divided into four sprints:

1. Sprint 1 (Days 1-30): Focus on laying a solid foundation in Python basics.
2. Sprint 2 (Days 31-60): Dive deeper into intermediate Python concepts and start working on small projects.
3. Sprint 3 (Days 61-90): Build more complex projects, explore advanced topics, and reinforce learning.
4. Sprint 4 (Days 91-100): Complete the challenge by solidifying knowledge and working on a final project.

Feel free to explore the code and follow along with my learning journey!
