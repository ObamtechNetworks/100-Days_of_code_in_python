Your Life in Weeks
Instructions
I was reading this article by Tim Urban -
Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html

Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days,
weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a
message with our time left in this format:

You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly,
even the positions of the commas and full stops.

Example Input
56

Example Output
You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.

e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:


Hint
There are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.
Try copying the example output into your code and replace the
relevant parts so that the sentence is formated the same way.

print("Let's see how many time you have left if you live until 90 years")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age? ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

# SOLUTION
base_age = 90
age = int(age)
days_left = (base_age - age) * 365
wks_left = (base_age - age) * 52
mnths_left = (base_age - age) * 12

time_left = f"You have {days_left} days, {wks_left} weeks, and {mnths_left} months left."
# PRINT TIME LEFT IN DAYS, WEEKS, MONTHS AND YEAR
print(time_left)
