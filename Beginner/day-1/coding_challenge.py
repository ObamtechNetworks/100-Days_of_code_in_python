Warning you should convert the result to a whole number.

Example Input
weight = 80

height = 1.75

Example Output
80 Ã· (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837

e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:

Check the data type of the inputs.
Try to use the exponent operator in your code.
Remember PEMDAS.
Remember to convert your result to a whole number (int).
